# Python on the Landscape of Programming Tools for Design and Architectural Education

Alexandre Barrozo do Amaral Villares; Daniel de Carvalho Moreira.

## Abstract
Currently most professional modeling and computer graphics software packages embed a scripting language. This is an early report on collecting data about software applications and coding tools geared towards the educational environment, preparing a listing for further evaluation and analysis of platforms. An increase in the adoption of Python as the embedded scripting syntax in many established tools can already be recognized, therefore the creation of educational materials on Python for design and architectural education merits further attention. Other insights on the educational potential of the available tools might be gained by advancing the data collection and evaluation work.
